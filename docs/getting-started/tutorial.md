## Introduction

React Router is a fully-featured client and server-side routing library for React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React Router runs anywhere React runs; on the web, on the server with node.js, and on React Native.

If you're just getting started with React generally, we recommend you follow [the excellent Getting Started guide](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) in the official docs. There is plenty of information there to get you up and running. React Router is compatible with React >= 16.8.

We'll keep this tutorial quick and to the point. By the end you'll know the APIs you deal with day-to-day with React Router. After that, you can dig into some of the other docs to get a deeper understanding.

While building a little bookeeping app we'll cover:

- Configuring Routes
- Navigating with Link
- Creating Links with active styling
- Using Nested Routes for Layout
- Navigating programatically
- Using URL params for data loading
- Using URL Search params
- Creating your own behaviors through composition
- Server Rendering

## Installation

You can skip bundlers and use [this repl.it](https://codesandbox) to code along in your browser. But note that their platform breaks the browser history in a lot of ways, so using the back/forward/refresh buttons in codesandbox are not reliable. Since that's the whole point of

If you prefer to do it locally, use [Create React App](https://npm.im/create-react-app) to get started:

```sh
npx create-react-app react-router-tutorial
cd react-router-tutorial
npm add react-router-dom@6 history@5
npm start
```

If you used Create React App, open up App.js and make sure it's pretty boring:

```tsx filename=src/App.js
export default function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>React Router!</h1>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Now go make sure `index.js` is likewise pretty boring:

```tsx filename=src/index.js
import { render } from "react-dom";
import App from "./App";

const rootElement = document.getElementById("root");
render(<App />, rootElement);
```

## Connect the URL

To connect your app to the browser's URL, import `BrowserRouter` and render it around your whole app in `src/index.js`:

```tsx lines=[2, 7-9] filename=src/index.js
import { render } from "react-dom";
import { BrowserRouter } from "react-router-dom";
import App from "./App";

const rootElement = document.getElementById("root");
render(
  <BrowserRouter>
    <App />
  </BrowserRouter>,
  rootElement
);
```

## Add Some Links

Open up `src/App.js`, import `Link` and add some global navigation. Oh, and don't take the styling too seriously in this tutorial.

```tsx lines=[1, 7-9] filename=src/App.js
import { Link } from "react-router-dom";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Bookkeeper</h1>
      <nav style={{ borderBottom: "solid 1px", paddingBottom: "1rem" }}>
        <Link to="/invoices">Invoices</Link> |{" "}
        <Link to="/expenses">Expenses</Link>
      </nav>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Go ahead and click the links and the back/forward button. React Router is now controlling the URL. We don't have any routes that render when the URL changes yet, but we can see that Link can change the URL without causing a full page reload.

## Add Some Routes

First add a couple new files:

- `src/routes/invoices.js`
- `src/routes/expenses.js`

(The location of the files doesn't matter, but when you decide you'd like an automatic backend API, server rendering, and code splitting bundler for this app, naming your files makes it easy to port this to our other project, [Remix](https://remix.run) ðŸ˜‰)

Now fill 'em up with some code:

```tsx filename=src/routes/expenses.js
export default function Expenses() {
  return <h2>Expenses</h2>;
}
```

```tsx filename=src/routes/invoices.js
export default function Invoices() {
  return <h2>Invoices</h2>;
}
```

Finally, let's create our first "route config" and teach Reach Router how to render our app at different URLs inside of `index.js`

YOU ARE ADDING STYLESCSS TO ALL OF THE CODE SAMPLES FOR INDEX>JS

```tsx lines=[2,4-5,10-14] filename=src/index.js
import { render } from "react-dom";
import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route } from "react-router-dom";
import App from "./App";
import Expenses from "./routes/expenses";
import Invoices from "./routes/invoices";

const rootElement = document.getElementById("root");
render(
  <BrowserRouter>
    <Routes>
      <Route path="/" element={<App />} />
      <Route path="expenses" element={<Expenses />} />
      <Route path="invoices" element={<Invoices />} />
    </Routes>
  </BrowserRouter>,
  rootElement
);
```

Notice at `"/"` it renders `<App>`. At `"/invoices"` it render `<Invoices>`. Nice work!

<docs-warning>If you're using code sandbox the inline browser's URL bar is pretty broken. You'll want to pop out by clicking the "open in new window" button in the top right to have the real browser handle the url history</docs-warning>

## Nested Routes

You may have noticed when clicking the links that the layout in `App` disappears. Repeating shared layouts is a pain in the neck. With React Router we've learned that most UI is a series of nested layouts that almost always map to segments of the URL, so this idea is baked right into React Router.

Let's get some automatic, persistent layout handling by doing just two things:

1. Nest the routes inside of the App route
2. Render an Outlet

```jsx lines=[11-14] filename=src/index.js
import { render } from "react-dom";
import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route } from "react-router-dom";
import App from "./App";
import Expenses from "./routes/expenses";
import Invoices from "./routes/invoices";

const rootElement = document.getElementById("root");
render(
  <BrowserRouter>
    <Routes>
      <Route path="/" element={<App />}>
        <Route path="expenses" element={<Expenses />} />
        <Route path="invoices" element={<Invoices />} />
      </Route>
    </Routes>
  </BrowserRouter>,
  rootElement
);
```

Notice how the expenses and invoices routes are **children** of the app route. This does two things:

1. It nests the URLs (`"/" + "expenses"`)
2. It will nest the UI components for shared layout when the child route matches

But before the second will work we need to render an `Outlet` in the parent route `App.js`

```jsx lines=[1,11] filename=src/App.js
import { Outlet, Link } from "react-router-dom";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Bookkeeper</h1>
      <nav style={{ borderBottom: "solid 1px", paddingBottom: "1rem" }}>
        <Link to="/invoices">Invoices</Link> |{" "}
        <Link to="/expenses">Expenses</Link>
      </nav>
      <Outlet />
    </div>
  );
}
```

Now as you click around again. The parent route (`App.js`) persists while the `<Outlet>` swaps between the two child routes (`<Invoices>` and `<Expenses>`).

As we'll see later, this works at _any level_ of the route hierarchy and is incredibly powerful.

## Listing the Invoices

Normally you'd be fetching data from a server somewhere, but for this tutorail lets just hard code some fake stuff so we can focus on routing.

Make a file at `src/data.js` and copy/paste this in there:

```js filename=src/data.js
let invoices = [
  {
    name: "Santa Monica",
    number: 1995,
    amount: "$10,800",
    due: -1
  },
  {
    name: "Stankonia",
    number: 2000,
    amount: "$8,000",
    due: 0
  },
  {
    name: "Ocean Avenue",
    number: 2003,
    amount: "$9,500",
    due: 8
  },
  {
    name: "Tubthumper",
    number: 1997,
    amount: "$14,000",
    due: 10
  },
  {
    name: "Wide Open Spaces",
    number: 1998,
    amount: "$4,600",
    due: false
  }
];

export function getInvoices() {
  return invoices;
}
```

Now we can use it in the invoices route. Let's also add a bit of styling to get a sidebar nav layout going on.

```js lines=[2,5,9-13] filename=src/routes/invoices.js
import { Link } from "react-router-dom";
import { getInvoices } from "../data";

export default function Invoices() {
  let invoices = getInvoices();
  return (
    <div style={{ display: "flex" }}>
      <nav style={{ borderRight: "solid 1px", padding: "1rem" }}>
        {invoices.map(invoice => (
          <Link
            style={{ display: "block", margin: "1rem 0" }}
            to={`/invoices/${invoice.id}`}
          >
            {invoice.name}
          </Link>
        ))}
      </nav>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Cool! Now click an invoice link and see what happens.

## Adding a "No Match" Route

Notice as you click the links the page goes blank! That's because none of the routes we've defined match a URL like the ones we're linking to: `"/invoices/123"`.

Before we move on, it's good practice to always handle the "no match" case. Go back to your route config and add this:

```js lines=[5] filename=src/index.js
<Routes>
  <Route path="/" element={<App />}>
    <Route path="expenses" element={<Expenses />} />
    <Route path="invoices" element={<Invoices />} />
    <Route path="*" element={<p>There's nothing here!</p>} />
  </Route>
</Routes>
```

The `"*"` has special meaning here. It will match only when no other routes do.

## Reading URL Params

Alright, back to the individual invoice URLs. Let's add a route for a specific invoice. We just visted some URLs like `"/invoices/1998"` and `"/invoices/2005"`, lets make a new component at `src/routes/invoice.js` to render at those URLs:

```js filename=src/routes/invoice.js
export default function Invoice() {
  return <h2>Invoice #???</h2>;
}
```

We'd like to render the invoice number instead of `"???"`. Normally in React you'd pass this as a prop: `<Invoice invoiceId="123" />`, but you don't control that information, it comes from the URL. Let's define a route that will match these kinds of URLs and enable us to get the invoice id from it.

Create a new `<Route>` _inside_ of the "invoices" route like this:

```js lines=[4-6] filename=src/routes/index.js
<Routes>
  <Route path="/" element={<App />}>
    <Route path="expenses" element={<Expenses />} />
    <Route path="invoices" element={<Invoices />}>
      <Route path=":invoiceId" element={<Invoice />} />
    </Route>
    <Route path="*" element={<p>There's nothing here!</p>} />
  </Route>
</Routes>
```

A couple things to note:

- We just created a route that matches urls like "/invoices/2005" and "/invoices/1998". The `:invoiceId` part of the path is a "URL param", meaning it can match any value as long as the pattern is the same.
- The `<Route>` adds a second layer of route nesting when it matches: `<App><Invoices><Invoice /></Invoices></App>`. Because the `<Route>` is nested the UI will be nested too.

Alright, now go click a link to an invoice, note that the URL changes but the new invoice component doesn't show up yet. Do you know why?

That's right! We need to add an outlet to the parent layout route (we're really proud of you).

```tsx lines=[1,18] filename=src/routes/invoices.js
import { Link } from "react-router-dom";
import { getInvoices } from "../data";

export default function Invoices() {
  let invoices = getInvoices();
  return (
    <div style={{ display: "flex" }}>
      <nav style={{ borderRight: "solid 1px", padding: "1rem" }}>
        {invoices.map(invoice => (
          <Link
            style={{ display: "block", margin: "1rem 0" }}
            to={`/invoices/${invoice.id}`}
          >
            {invoice.name}
          </Link>
        ))}
      </nav>
      <Outlet />
    </div>
  );
}
```

Okay, let's close the circle here. Open up the invoice component again and let's get the `:invoiceId` param from the URL:

```ts lines=[1,4] filename=src/routes/invoice.js
import { useParams } from "react-router-dom";

export default function Invoice() {
  let params = useParams();
  return <h2>Invoice: {params.invoiceId}</h2>;
}
```

Note that the key of the param on the `params` object is the same as the dynamic segment in the route path:

```
:invoiceId -> params.invoiceId
```

Let's use that information to build up a more interesting invoice page. Open up `src/data.js` and add a new function to lookup invoices by their number:

```js filename=src/data.js lines=[7-9]
// ...

export function getInvoices() {
  return invoices;
}

export function getInvoice(number) {
  return invoices.find(invoice => invoice.number === number);
}
```

And now back in `invoice.js` we can display use the param to look it up and display more information:

```js filename=routes/invoice.js lines=[2,6]
import { useParams } from "react-router-dom";
import { getInvoice } from "../data";

export default function Invoice() {
  let params = useParams();
  let invoice = getInvoice(parseInt(params.invoiceId, 10));
  return (
    <main style={{ padding: "1rem" }}>
      <h2>Total Due: {invoice.amount}</h2>
      <p>
        {invoice.name}: {invoice.number}
      </p>
      <p>Due Date: {invoice.due}</p>
    </main>
  );
}
```

Note that we used `parseInt` around the param. It's very common for your data lookups to use a `number` type, but URL params are always `string`.

## Index Routes

Index routes are possibly the most difficult concept in React Router for people to understand. So if you've struggled before, we hope this can clarify it for you.

Right now you're probably looking at one of the invoices. Click on the "Invoices" link in the global nav of your app. Notice that the main content error goes blank! We can fix this with an "index" route.

```jsx filename=src/index.js lines=[5]
<Routes>
  <Route path="/" element={<App />}>
    <Route path="expenses" element={<Expenses />} />
    <Route path="invoices" element={<Invoices />}>
      <Route index element={<p>Select an invoice</p>}>
      <Route path=":invoiceId" element={<Invoice />} />
    </Route>
    <Route path="*" element={<p>There's nothing here!</p>} />
  </Route>
</Routes>
```

Awesome! Now the index route fills the space when we're at just `"/invoices"`. Notice it has the `index` prop instead of a `path`. That's because the index route shares the path of the parent. That's the whole point, it doesn't have a path. There are a few ways we try to answer the question "what is an index route?". Hopefully one of these sticks for you:

- Index routes render at the parent route's path.
- Index routes match when a parent route matches but none of the other children match.
- Index routes are the default child route for a parent route.
- Index routes render when the user hasn't clicked one of the items in a navigation list yet.

## Active Links

It's very common, especially in navigation lists, to display the link as the active link the user is looking at. Let's add this treatment to our invoices list.

```jsx lines=[1,10-17,22] filename=src/routes/invoices.js
import { NavLink, Outlet } from "react-router-dom";
import { getInvoices } from "../data";

export default function Invoices() {
  let invoices = getInvoices();
  return (
    <div style={{ display: "flex" }}>
      <nav style={{ borderRight: "solid 1px", padding: "1rem" }}>
        {invoices.map(invoice => (
          <NavLink
            style={({ isActive }) => {
              return {
                display: "block",
                margin: "1rem 0",
                color: isActive ? "red" : ""
              };
            }}
            key={invoice.number}
            to={`/invoices/${invoice.number}`}
          >
            {invoice.name}
          </NavLink>
        ))}
      </nav>
      <Outlet />
    </div>
  );
}
```

We did two three things there:

1. We swapped out `Link` for `NavLink`.
2. We changed the `style` from a simple object to a function that returns an object.
3. We changed the color of our link by looking at the `isActive` value that `NavLink` passed to our styling function.

You can do the same thing with `className` on `NavLink`:

```jsx
// normal string
<NavLink className="red" />

// function
<NavLink className={({ isActive }) => isActive ? "red" : "blue"} />
```

## Search Params

Search params are like URL params but they sit in a different position in the URL. Instead of being in the normal URL segments separated by `/`, they are at the end after a `?`. You've seen them across the web like "/login?success=1" or "/shoes?brand=nike&sort=asc&sortby=price".

React Router makes it easy to read and manipulate the search params with `useSearchParams`. It works a lot like `React.useState()` but stores and sets the state in the URL search params instead of in memory.

Let's see it in action by adding a little filter on the invoices nav list.

```jsx filename=routes/invoices.js lines=[1,6,11-20,22-27]
import { NavLink, Outlet, useSearchParams } from "react-router-dom";
import { getInvoices } from "../data";

export default function Invoices() {
  let invoices = getInvoices();
  let [searchParams, setSearchParams] = useSearchParams();

  return (
    <div style={{ display: "flex" }}>
      <nav style={{ borderRight: "solid 1px", padding: "1rem" }}>
        <input
          value={searchParams.get("filter") || ""}
          onChange={event => {
            let filter = event.target.value;
            if (filter) {
              setSearchParams({ filter });
            } else {
              setSearchParams({});
            }
          }}
        />
        {invoices
          .filter(invoice => {
            let filter = searchParams.get("filter");
            if (!filter) return true;
            let name = invoice.name.toLowerCase();
            return name.startsWith(filter.toLowerCase());
          })
          .map(invoice => (
            <NavLink
              style={({ isActive }) => ({
                display: "block",
                margin: "1rem 0",
                color: isActive ? "red" : ""
              })}
              key={invoice.number}
              to={`/invoices/${invoice.number}`}
            >
              {invoice.name}
            </NavLink>
          ))}
      </nav>
      <Outlet />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Custom Behavior

If you filter the list and then click a link, you'll notice that the list is no longer filtered and the search param is cleared in the input and the URL. You might not like this. Maybe you want to keep the list filtered and keep the param in the URL.

We can persist the query string when we click a link by adding it to the link's href. We'll do that by composing `NavLink` and `useLocation` from React Router into our own `QueryNavLink` (maybe there's a better name, but that's what we're going with today).

```js
import { useLocation, NavLink } from "react-router-dom";

function QueryNavLink({ to, ...props }) {
  let location = useLocation();
  return <NavLink to={to + location.search} {...props} />;
}
```

Like `useSearchParams`, `useLocation` tells us information about the URL, but it's lower level. It looks something like this:

```js
{
  pathame: "/invoices",
  search: "?filter=sa",
  hash: "",
  state: null,
  key: "ae4cz2j"
}
```

With that information, the task in `QueryNavLink` is pretty simple: add the `location.search` onto the `to` prop. You might be thinking, "Geez, seems like this should be a built-in component of React Router or something?". Well, let's look at another example.

What if you had links like this on an ecommerce site.

```jsx
<Link to="/shoes?brand=nike">Nike</Link>
<Link to="/shoes?brand=vans">Vans</Link>
```

And then you wanted to style them as "active" when the url search params match the brand? You could make a component that does exactly that pretty quickly with stuff you've learned in this tutorial:

```jsx
function BrandLink({ brand, ...props }) {
  let [params] = useSearchParams();
  let isActive = params.getAll("brand").includes(brand);
  return (
    <Link
      style={{ color: isActive ? "red" : "" }}
      to={`/shoes?brand=${brand}`}
      {...props}
    />
  );
}
```

That's going to be active for `"/shoes?brand=nike"` as well as `"/shoes?brand=nike&brand=vans"`. Maybe you want it to be active when there's only one brand selected:

```js
let brands = params.getAll("brand");
let isActive = brands.includes(brand) && brands.length === 1;
// ...
```

Or maybe you want the links to be _additive_ (clicking Nike and then Vans adds both brands to the search params) instead of replacing the brand:

```jsx [4-6,10]
function BrandLink({ brand, ...props }) {
  let [params] = useSearchParams();
  let isActive = params.getAll("brand").includes(brand);
  if (!isActive) {
    params.append("brand", brand);
  }
  return (
    <Link
      style={{ color: isActive ? "red" : "" }}
      to={`/shoes?${params.toString()}`}
      {...props}
    />
  );
}
```

Or maybe you want it to add the brand if it's not there already and remove it if it's clicked again!

```jsx [6-12]
function BrandLink({ brand, ...props }) {
  let [params] = useSearchParams();
  let isActive = params.getAll("brand").includes(brand);
  if (!isActive) {
    params.append("brand", brand);
  } else {
    params = new URLSearchParams(
      Array.from(params).filter(
        ([key, value]) => key !== "brand" || value !== branch
      )
    );
  }
  return (
    <Link
      style={{ color: isActive ? "red" : "" }}
      to={`/shoes?${params.toString()}`}
      {...props}
    />
  );
}
```

As you can see, even in this fairly simple example there are a lot of valid behaviors you might want. React Router doesn't try to solve every use-case we've ever heard of directly. Instead, we give you the components and hooks to compose whatever behavior you need.

## Navigating Programatically

You're almost done! Most of the time the URL changes it was the user who clicked a link to change it. But sometimes you, the programmer, want to change the URL. A very common use case is after a data update like creating or deleting a record.

Let's add a button that marks the invoice as paid and then navigates up to the index route.

```js lines=[1,5,16-24] filename=src/routes/invoice.js
import { useParams, useNavigate } from "react-router-dom";
import { getInvoice } from "../data";

export default function Invoice() {
  let navigate = useNavigate();
  let params = useParams();
  let invoice = getInvoice(parseInt(params.invoiceId, 10));

  return (
    <main style={{ padding: "1rem" }}>
      <h2>Total Due: {invoice.amount}</h2>
      <p>
        {invoice.name}: {invoice.number}
      </p>
      <p>Due Date: {invoice.due}</p>
      <p>
        <button
          onClick={() => {
            // markPaid(invoice);
            navigate("/invoices");
          }}
        >
          Mark Paid
        </button>
      </p>
    </main>
  );
}
```

Of course, we didn't really change anything about our data in this example. We're just showing you the API you'd use along with whatever data abstractions you've got.

## Server Rendering

The most basic server rendering in React Router is pretty straightforward.

However, there's a lot more to consider than just getting the right routes to render. Here's an incomplete list of things you'll need to consider:

- Bundling your code for the server and the browser
- Not bundling server-only code into the browser bundles
- Server Side data loading so you actually have something to render
- Data loading strategies that work on the client and server
- Handling code splitting in the server and client
- Proper HTTP status codes and redirects
- Deployment

Setting all of this up well can be really difficult.

If you want to server render your React Router app, we highly recommend you use [Remix](https://remix.run). This is another project of ours. It's built on top of React Router and handles all of the things mentioned above and more. Give it a shot!

If you want to tackle it on your own, you'll need to use `<StaticRouter>` on the server.

First you'll need some sort of "app" or "root" component that gets rendered on the server and in the browser:

```js filename=App.js
export default function App() {
  return (
    <html>
      <head>
        <title>Server Rendered App</title>
      </head>
      <body>
        <Routes>
          <Route path="/" element={<div>Home</div>} />
          <Route path="/about" element={<div>About</div>} />
        </Routes>
        <script src="/build/client.entry.js" />
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

Here's the browser entry point (you've already seen this kind of code in this tutorial):

```js filename=client.entry.js
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import { BrowserRouter } from "react-router-dom";
import App from "./App";

ReactDOM.render(
  <BrowserRouter>
    <App />
  </BrowserRouter>,
  document.documentElement
);
```

And finally, here's a simple express server that renders the same thing.

```js filename=server.entry.js
import express from "express"
import ReactDOMServer from "react-dom/server";
import { StaticRouter } from "react-router-dom";
import App from "./App";

let app = express();

app.get("*", ((req, res)) => {
  let html = ReactDOMServer.renderToString(
    <StaticRouter location={req.url}>
      <App/>
    </StaticRouter>
  );
  res.send("<!DOCTYPE html>" + html);
})

app.listen(3000);
```

The only real differences from the client entry are:

- `StaticRouter` instead of `BrowserRouter`
- passing the URL from the server to `<StaticRouter url>`
- Using `ReactDOMServer.renderToString` instead of `ReactDOM.render`.

Some parts you'll need to fill for this to work:

- How to bundle the code to work in the browser and server
- How to know where the client entry is for `<script>` in the `<App>` component.
- Figuring out data loading (especially for the `<title>`).

Again, we recommend you give [Remix](https://remix.run) a look.
